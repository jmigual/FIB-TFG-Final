I would like to thank my director Dr. Benjamin Haibe-Kains director Bioinformatics and 
Computational Genomics Laboratory at Princess Margaret Cancer 
Centre. He reviewed my work and helped me whenever I had a question.

I would also like to thank to Dr. Maria José Serna Iglesias and Joan Marcè i Rived 
that helped me reviewing the final document.

I would also like to thank Dr. Miguel Angel Barja Yáñez, director of CFIS at UPC which 
made possible the contact with University of Toronto and thus made this project possible.

I must express my very profound gratitude to my family for providing me with unfailing 
support and continuous encouragement throughout my years of study and through the process 
of researching and writing this thesis. 

Finally I would like to thank God for making me a curious being and providing me with 
this opportunity.
