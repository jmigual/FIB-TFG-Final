This project is centered around the survival analysis problem. Its objective
is to create a model that is able to predict the survival outcome of Princess 
Margaret Cancer Centre patients.

To do so a deep learning model has been used in combination from radiomic features
extracted from Computed Tomography scans together with the clinical information
provided for each patient.

Radiomics is a recent is a new field, relying on pre-defined, 
hand-engineered features computed from medical images, to better characterize tumours 
and predict survival outcome.
